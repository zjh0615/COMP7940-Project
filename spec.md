# COMP 7940 CLOUD COMPUTING PROJECT

## Project outline
The project is a line-based chatbot that can respond to users' questions about public health issues with suggestions or solutions
###Design
The chatbot can respond to three topics.
1. Check local mask shops in Hong Kong and order masks online. The chatbot responds to the name of a street shop in which district of Hong Kong the shop is located. If you want to order a mask, the chatbot will ask for the amount and the user can respond accordingly. After confirming the reservation, the chatbot will send the quantity to the store and complete the mask reservation.
2. Pay attention to the real-time number of coronavirus. Users input the number of confirmed cases, and the chatbot returns the current number of confirmed cases and suspected cases in China. To find out how many people have been diagnosed in a particular region, users simply type in the name of the city, such as Hong Kong. The chatbot will respond to the latest local diagnosis
